The data presented to you is a record of a job satisfaction survey taken in an organisation. I created a Power BI report using the data provided.
My solution includes the following:

• Top 3 managers with the highest scores
• The dashboard defaults to the latest month in the data and automatically update each
month
• Percentage of employees returning overall scores of 6 or lower
